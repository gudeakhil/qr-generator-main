here is the preview - https://qr-gen-saswat.netlify.app/

This is a small project I made while learning HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
The idea was simple, type anything and it makes a QR code for it.

I used a free JavaScript library for generating the qr and the rest is just basic UI stuff..
i'm still learning, so the code might not be perfect, but it works 🙂

Features:
- Generate QR codes instantly
- Works for text links numbers and more
- Clean dark theme
- Simple and beginner-friendly

Project Structure is below
index.html
style.css
script.js

Why I made This:
Since i am learning JS, CSS and HTML i thought this would be a good way to practice what i know..
also i wanted to build something that looks decent and actually works.

some improvements i will make in future:
- give an option to download the QR
- will add better animations
- provide more color options

- Cleaner and more professional looking UI
